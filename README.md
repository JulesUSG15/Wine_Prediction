# Wine Quality Prediction

## Introduction

This project develops machine learning and deep learning models to predict wine quality, based on physico-chemical characteristics. It uses two separate datasets for white and red wine, with models built separately for each type. TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning library, was used alongside other tools to analyse the data and build the models.

## Datasets

- `winequality-white.csv`: Contains data and physico-chemical characteristics of white wines, as well as their quality.
- winequality-red.csv`: Contains the data and physico-chemical characteristics of red wines, as well as their quality.

## Technologies used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation

## Project Structure

- Wine_white_Prediction.ipynb` : Notebook for white wine quality prediction.
- Wine_red_Prediction.ipynb` : Notebook for red wine quality prediction.
- winequality-white.csv` : Dataset for white wine.
- winequality-red.csv` : Dataset for red wine.

## Installation

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow jupyter
```

## Usage

Open the `Wine_white_Prediction.ipynb` and `Wine_red_Prediction.ipynb` notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to follow the complete process of modelling, training, evaluating and visualising prediction results for white and red wines.

## Results

The notebooks present a detailed analysis of the data, the construction and evaluation of the machine learning and deep learning models, and the interpretation of the results through various metrics and visualisations.

## Conclusion

The project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models, using TensorFlow, in predicting the quality of white and red wines. This approach offers a valuable perspective on the application of artificial intelligence in the field of oenology and opens up avenues for future research aimed at improving the accuracy of predictions.
